This project has been created to demonstrate the development of an automotive instrument cluster using PyQt framework. 

This application has been completely developed with the help of Github Co-pilot / cursor coding assistants and intended for demonstration purposes only.

Refer workshop3_1.py file for the actual HMI application source code developed using Decks and Cards approach similar to Altia HMI development tool.

1. 'DECK_GRAPHICS' defines the Decks and cards configuration

2. 'CHIME_FILES' defines the chime configuration

3. 'TELL_TALES' defines the tell tale configuration

4. 'ZONE_COORDINATES' defines the various zone coordinates

Usage:

Run test_runner3_1.py to perform standalone execution / testing.

Run test_runner_rest_server.py, test_tool_rest_client.py to perform REST interface (fastAPI) based remote testing.
